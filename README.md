Part 1:
Build an invoice editor in React that allows a user add, edit, or remove line items according to the text-based mockup below. Pricing should be updated on-the-fly as line items are added or edited. Don't worry about persisting invoices. Don't worry about styling.
```

--------------------------------------------------------
